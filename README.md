# Social Distance Mask Detector

## Introduction 

### Project Statement

Design a computer vision model to detect facemask along with interpersonal proximity. Send alerts if social distancing is not maintained.

### Approach

The project can be broken down into two sections:
I.	Detect facemask
II.	Determine object proximity 

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

Please ensure you have the [lastest Python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system. 
You will also require a package manager (such as [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)) to install dependencies.
Once installed and ready, download the repo, unzip, go to the folder and create a virtual environment:

>python3 -m \<venv\> /path/to/new/virtual/environment

where `venv` is your environment name. Activate the environment by:

> source \<venv\>/bin/activate

Once the venv is active, run the following to install requirements: 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

***IMPORTANT: These requirements are specific to macOS systems with Apple Silicon based processors (M1, M1 Pro, etc.) ONLY. Kindly check the requirements file before proceeding.***
